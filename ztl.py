# list of upcoming algorithms..
# - how would you find a mean in an array? what's the complexity of the function?
# - write a program that outputs all prime numbers below N?
# - If I give you an array of integers, L, and another integer, s, can you write a program
# to find out whether there exists a *pair* of integers in L which sum up to s. What's
# the time complexity of this program? Can you find a faster version?
# - write code that finds element in list that only appears once
