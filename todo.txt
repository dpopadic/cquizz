Comparing e to the power of pi and pi to the power of e  which one is bigger.

Roll two dice for infinite times, what is the prob that you get a sum of 4 before a sum of 2?
You can rephrase the question as “what’s the probability of getting a sum of 4 given that you got a sum of 2?” However, notice that the outcome of rolling a dice is independent of any previous rolls. Hence getting a sum of 2 before getting a sum of 4 is irrelevant. Really, all you need to find is the probability of getting a sum of 4. This is the easy part.

For getting 4 it is:
There are 36 possible configurations of the two die (6*6=36), and only 3 of which add up to 4: {(1,3), (3,1), (2,2)}. So the answer is 3/36 = 1/12.
For getting 2 it is: 1/36

You call the home of a family w/ two children and a kid "billy" answers the phone. What is the probability that both children are boys?
It's 1 in 3. Of the possible combinations of two children, BB, BG, GB and GG, we have eliminated one possibility (GG). Of the three remaining possibilities, one of them is two boys. So the probability is 1/3.

If I give you an array of integers, L, and another integer, s, can you write a program to find out whether there exists a *pair* of integers in L which sum up to s. What's the time complexity of this program? Can you find a faster version?

unbiased estimator

If you toss an unbiased coin, what is the expected number of tosses you will make before you toss three tails?
We note X the number of tosses to get to 3 tails(successes), so X follows a negative binomial distribution. and the expectation of a negative binomial random variable E[X] := r/p, where r is the number of tails(successes), and p is the probability to get a tail(success) which here is 1/2. So the expected number of tosses E[X] = 3/(1/2) = 6

n people standing in a row with all of them having different heights. Expected position of the tallest guy.he tallest person can either be in the first position, the second position and so on till the nth position.
->
The sample space is Ω={1,2,3,4,…n}
Each of these outcomes have equal probability, that is 1/n.
Therefore, the expected value is
1/n+2/n+3/n+…+n/n
This sum evaluates to (n+1)/2.

What is the expected number of tosses required to achieve 2 heads in an unbiased coin?  
Expected number of steps required to obtain N consecutive heads by tossing a fair coin is given by

For n = 2 ; E2 = 6

How do you create an event with a probability of 1/3 using  an unbiased coin?
unbiased coin has P(H) = P(T) = 1/2.
To create the event that the question desires, do follow:
first, understand that P(HH) = P(HT) = P(TH) = P(TT) = 1/4

if you flip coin 2 times in a row:
1) HH happens -&gt; do sth
2) HT happens -&gt; do another stuff
3) TH happens -&gt; do other stuff
4) if TT happens -&gt; reroll coin 2 times again and go back .

This guarantees that we only observe 1/3 events.


Consider a random walk on a discrete grid of 11 points  (0 through 10). Supposed you have equal probabilty of stepping up or down. If you reach either 10 or 0 you must stop. If you start at point 6, what is the probability that you arrive at 10 before you arrive at 0?
The quickest way to solve this problem is to realize that this random walk is a martingale. Therefor, its conditional expectation value is equal to its initial value. Over a long enough time period you will arrive at either 10 or 0 (ergodic hypothesis). Let p be the probability of arriving at 10 before 0. Then 6 = 10*p + 0*(1-p). Or p = 6/10.

Given a round table, randomly place three legs under the table, what is probability that the table will fall?  

a, b, c are integers. Such that a^2 + 2bc = 1; b^2 + 2ac=2012, find all the possibles values of c^2 + 2ab.  
simple eq:
(a+b+c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2bc + 2ca.
from given eq, we know:
(a+b+c)^2 = (2012 + 1 + UNKNOWN) = K^2

with K being anything larger than 45.
45*45 = 2025
46*46 = 2116 ..
so you can figure out the missing term by: (K^2 - 2013)

What does a distribution with a maximal variance look like which is only defined between 0 and 1? Give the proof.  
You'd want the values to be at either 0 or 1, since anything in between just brings them closer to the mean (not fully rigorous, but should be obvious enough). let p be the density at 0, so (1-p) is the density at 1. Then mean = (1-p). Variance is: p*(1-p)^2+(1-p)*p^2 = p-2p^2+p^3+p^2-p^3 = p-p^2

We want to maximize variance, to take the first derivative and set it to 0:
1-2p = 0
p=1/2

Hence, half the density is at 0, half at 1.
