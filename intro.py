# how would you find a mean in an array? what's the complexity of the function?

# write a program that outputs all prime numbers below N?

# If I give you an array of integers, L, and another integer, s, can you write a program
# to find out whether there exists a *pair* of integers in L which sum up to s. What's
# the time complexity of this program? Can you find a faster version?

# algo to compute square root

# sorting algo

# why python (vs R)? because of general purpose libraries for translation, text extraction from img etc..

# write code that finds element in list that only appears once
